# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This repository is dedicated to my learning journey through Algorithms and Data Structures in Java. I'm currently
learning from [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) by Aditya Y. Bhargava. As I learn
and implement different algorithms, I will document my progress and share my solutions here, along with unit tests for
each algorithm.

## Algorithms Implemented

So far, the following algorithms have been implemented (`src/main/java/dev/mirodil/java_dsa/basics`):

### 1. Linear Search

Linear Search is a simple search algorithm that looks for a target value within a list by checking each element one by
one.

- **Algorithm**: Linear search
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)

### 2. Binary Search

Binary Search is a more efficient search algorithm that works on sorted lists by repeatedly dividing the search interval
in half.

- **Algorithm**: Binary search
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)

### 3. Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the list into a sorted and unsorted part and repeatedly
selects the smallest element from the unsorted part.

- **Algorithm**: Selection sort
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2)
